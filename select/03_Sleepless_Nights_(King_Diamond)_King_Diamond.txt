I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway

And as the clock strikes midnight
I hear them dancing at the graves
Singing to my mind

Killing the pain
Sleepless nights
Sleepless nights

I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway

And as the clock strikes midnight
Who only they can let us meet
Even though she's dead now

I cannot see her again
Sleepless nights
Sleepless nights

I cannot sleep at night
I will do anything to see Missy again

Then let us make you an eternal deal
You will attend to the graves
You'll give us the house back and keep in mind
That we only come here at night

So we made the deal under the starry night and
Amon belongs to them now
I feel the dawn coming my way

And as the sun breaks up the dark
I can't hear them dance no more
There is no voices
Killing the pain
