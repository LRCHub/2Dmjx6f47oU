Oh Yeah.
I Stay Up On The High Until The Morning
Stay In Bed Until Day Becomes Light
I've Been So Refused
Even More Confused
I Wish I Could Make It Right
Looks Like A Sleepless Night Coming My Way
Yeah, I Knew That I'd Be Feeling This Way
On A Sleepless Night
Got A Restless Mind
On A Sleepless Night
I've Been Waiting For You
On A Sleepless Night
Gonna Tell You One More Time
You're All I Need On A Sleepless Night
You Got Tired Of The Way You Were Feeling
Threw Away Your Ball And Chain
Your Shot In The Dark
Put A Hole In My Heart
Still I'm The One That's Taking The Blame
Looks Like A Sleepless Night Coming My Way
Yeah, I Knew That I'd Be Feeling This Way
On A Sleepless Night
I Got A Restless Mind
On A Sleepless Night
I've Been Waiting For You
On A Sleepless Night
Gonna Tell You One More Time
You're All I Need On A Sleepless Night
On A Sleepless Night
Listen To The Music
On A Sleepless Night
Try To Leave Your Troubles All Behind
On A Sleepless Night
Wide Awake
Lying On The Bed
Can't Find No Peace At Mind
Because It's So Hard To Unwind
Looks Like A Sleepless Nights Coming My Way
Yeah, I Knew That I'd Be Feeling This Way
On A Sleepless Night
Got A Restless Mind
On A Sleepless Night
I've Been Praying For You
On A Sleepless Night
Gonna Tell You One More Time
You're All I Need On A Sleepless Night
On A Sleepless Night
On A Sleepless Nigh
