So many lights are on the repeat
A glowing dark is coming to the streets

We catch the magic of the sights
We breathe again with the neon from the heights

Tell me did you ever want it?
Just to stay here by my side
It is a magic of the moments
Under the sleepless sky

Tell me did you ever feel it?
A static touch beneath your skin
It's the rhythm of the heartbeat
So deep within

So sleepless nights
So wrong and right
Starting from the early midnight
Straight on till the morning light

So sleepless nights
We cant deny
Waking the spark of neon moonlight
Just like strangers of delight

And now we cannot stop the stream
We light the arc, we changed the gravity

Surrounded by the shining signs
We dream again how we could stop the time

Tell me did you ever want it?
Just to stay out of the dark
In an everlasting moment
Under electric stars

Tell me did you ever feel it?
A flash connection to the dreams
In the rhythm of the heartbeat
So deep within

So sleepless nights
So wrong and right
Starting from the early midnight
Straight on till the morning light

So sleepless nights
We can't deny
Waking the spark of neon moonlight
Just like strangers of delight

So sleepless nights
So wrong and right
Starting from the early midnight
Straight on till the morning light

So sleepless nights
We can't deny
Waking the spark of neon moonlight
Just like strangers of delight

(So sleepless nights)
(We can't deny)
(Waking the spark of neon moonlight)
(Just like strangers of delight)

So sleepless nights
So wrong and right
Starting from the early midnight
Straight on till the morning light

So sleepless nights
We can't deny
Waking the spark of neon moonlight
Just like strangers of delight
Just like strangers in the night
